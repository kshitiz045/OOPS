 # Inheritance
 
 Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. 
 
 
 #Types of Inheritance

There are Various types of inheritance in Java:

1. Single Inheritance :- In Single Inheritance, one class extends another class (one class only). 

2. Multiple Inheritance :- In Multiple Inheritance, one class extending more than one class. Java does not support multiple inheritance.

3. Multilevel Inheritance :- In Multilevel Inheritance, one class can inherit from a derived class. Hence, the derived class becomes the base class for the new class. 

4. Hierarchical Inheritance :- In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class is inherited by many sub classes.

5. Hybrid Inheritance :- Hybrid inheritance is a combination of Single and Multiple inheritance.
