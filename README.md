# OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)

Basic and Main Principles :-

1. Inheritance :- Inheritance is a mechanism that lets you describe a new class based on an existing (parent) class. In doing so, the new class borrows the properties and functionality of the parent class. 

2. Abstraction :- This is a very simple principle. Abstraction means to identify the main, most significant characteristics of something, while simultaneously discarding anything minor and insignificant.

3. Encapsulation :- In Java, encapsulation means restricting the ability to read and change data. 

4. Polymorphism :- Polymorphism is the ability to work with several types as if they were the same type. Moreover, the objects' behavior will be different depending on their type.
